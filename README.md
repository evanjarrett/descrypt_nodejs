# descrypt_nodejs
DES algorithm ported to javascript.

This implementation is based of code from:
https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt

# WARNING! 
Please don't actually use this to encrypt things. This algorithm is terribly insecure (as the tests show).

This was done because I couldn't find a proper port/implementation of this algorithm in javascript.
